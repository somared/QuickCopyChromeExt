Not all websites allow auto filling especially your company's work website. You may have long user IDs, emails, account numbers, etc which you need to type everyday. Quick Copy extension allows you to configure such text and easily copy right from your browser with two clicks. 

Features:
-----------------
- Quickly copy configured text to clipboard. 
- Background color to group or quickly identify words to be copied. Very helpful during busy day.
- Syncs the configured data across devices. (This requires you to enable Sync functionality in your browser)

Permissions:
-----------------
This extension does not have access to webpage or any content. It does not transmit any data. The ONLY permission needed is "storage" which is used for storing your configured text.
